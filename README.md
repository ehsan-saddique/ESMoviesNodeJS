# Prerequisites
* Application is developed using `Nodejs`, `Express` and `MongoDB`.
* I couldn't find any free plateform to deploy this application with MongoDB, so you'll have to run this locally.
* Nodejs, npm and MongoDB must be installed on your machine for this application to work.
* Application doesn't have any user interface or view, on the startup it will fetch the data from Amazon service and insert it to MongoDB named `s3_amazon`.
* I used WebStorm <https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm> to develop and run the application locally.
